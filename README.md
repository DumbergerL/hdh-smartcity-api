# AA-HDH SmartCity API

Aalen and Heidenheim are jointly developing their cities into smart cities. The long-term plan is to [create a data platform](https://www.aahdhgemeinsamdigital.de/massnahmen/massnahme-5) to break down data silos. As long as this platform has not yet been realised, this API wrapper tool will help to retrieve the data from the dashboards. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The reverse engineering of unofficial web APIs is highly experimental. The API can change constantly. Even if this project is intended to guarantee a certain degree of stability, changes cannot be ruled out.

## API Example Reqeusts

To test API endpoints, I use [Bruno](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno) instead of e.g. Postman because the sample requests can be versioned in git. The sample requests are stored in the `bruno-api` folder.
